He lives in Portland, OR.

His work bends traditional notions of composition and color expression.
It seamlessly incorporates different styles of oil painting
to explore spaces: What was there already, and what we put there, and what isn't really there at all.
It's been described as "dark, but bright".
Asked whether the little stories that sometimes accompany his work are true,
he has said:

  text="Absolutely they are true. Just... not necessarily in the sense of 'this actually happened.'",
  author="Matt O'Tousa"
) }}

Lately, he's been thinking about doors.
