Between antiquity and the 16th century, painters were largely
a tool of the very rich, by which they would celebrate themselves, their wealth,
their heritage, their mistresses.
Or of the church, a tool by which to impress their god upon the common folk through
finery unlike that seen in day-to-day life.
Painters would haggle with patrons over pigments used not for their hue or
vibrance, but solely for their monetary value.
The more money spent on raw materials, the more prestigous its subject matter.
