Let me preface this by saying I am not saying I am anti-nudity or anti-sex in art at all.
When I refer to the nude I'm speaking of a specific sort of naked portrait that
is mostly historical as far as I know.
The nude sucks because the rich used paintings to celebrate what they possessed,
and these overwhelmingly celebrate the man of women.
