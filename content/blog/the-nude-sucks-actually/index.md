Let me preface this by saying I am not saying I am anti-nudity or anti-sex in art at all.
When I refer to the nude I'm speaking of a specific sort of naked portrait that
is historical and celebrated as high art but actually really just
kind of gross.
The nude sucks because the rich used paintings to celebrate what they possessed...
like women.
