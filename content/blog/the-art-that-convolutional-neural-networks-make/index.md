It's always good when the tools to create art get more accessible, right?
"More accessible" often means "cheaper", but the accessibility is what matters.
Another way to make art "more accessible" is to make it easier.
Think the advancement of camera technology, from complex and high-skill equipment 
in darkrooms on film, to many of us able to take pretty decent photos from a phone
we already need to have for a thousand other reasons.

'AI Art' is a hot topic right now.
Specifically, the kind of images made in convolutional
neural networks after they process what experts call 'a metric fuckton' of input data.
The technology is really neat and the output is really impressive... so long as
you don't care too much if your art has human emotion or decent looking hands.

One big problem that comes up a lot with 'AI Art' is copyright.
See, in those huge sets of input data needed for a neural network to chew on to 'learn', every single image belongs to somebody in the eyes of the law.
I don't love copyright. But it *tries* to make it harder to exploit artists
and ensure they can profit off their work, which is good, because artists
unfortunately do still need to eat.
(I would love to see copyright abolished but there are a lot of other more important things that would need to happen first)

Convolutional neural networks are no more 'intelligent' than any other algorithm.
There's not really any compelling evidence we've come meaningfully closer to creating
general intelligence in the entire history of forever.
Industrial futurists dreamed of brains made of gears, after all.
The way we look at creating a brain through sheer computation may
seem just as ridiculous to people someday.

The tricky part of evaluating non-human intelligence is that all we've really
got to go off are the vibes.
But then again, all we've really ever had to 'prove' humans are even intelligent
are the vibes.
I am me, so it makes an intuitive sense that you are you.
Whereas we have no such intuition about machines.

I do believe AI techniques have a place in the creative process,
but once the novelty wears off, does anyone really want to be
told stories by machines?

I mean, don't we tell stories to connect to people?
