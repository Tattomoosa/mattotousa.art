It's always good when the tools to create art get more accessible, right?
"More accessible" often just means "cheaper", but the accessibility is what matters.
Another way to make art "more accessible" is to make it easier.
Think the advancement of camera technology, from complex and high-skill equipment 
in darkrooms on film, to many of us able to take pretty decent photos without owning
a dedicated camera.

'AI Art' is a hot topic right now.
Specifically, the kind of images made in convolutional
neural networks after they process what the experts call 'a metric fuckton' of input data.
The technology is really neat and the output is really impressive... so long as
you don't care too much if your art has real human emotions or hands.

One big problem with 'AI Art' is copyright.
See, in those huge sets of input data needed for a neural network to chew on to 'learn', every single image belongs to somebody in the eyes of the law.
I don't love copyright. But it *tries* to make it harder to exploit artists
and ensure they can profit off their work, which is good, because artists need profit to survive just like the rest of us.

I would love to see copyright abolished but it's also kind of necessary for artists to survive in capitalism so it is what it is I guess.

Convolutional neural networks are no more 'intelligent' than any other algorithm.
There's not really any compelling evidence we've come meaningfully closer to general
intelligence in the entire history of computing.
Maybe we have, maybe we haven't, all we've really got are the vibes.
But then again, all we've really got to 'prove' other people are intelligent are the vibes too.
I am me, so it makes intuitive sense that you are you.
But we have no such intuition about machines.

But at some point it gets weird. I do believe AI techniques have a place in the
creative process, but once the novelty wears off, does anyone really want to be
told stories by machines?

I mean, don't we tell stories to connect to people?
