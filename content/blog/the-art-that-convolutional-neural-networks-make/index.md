It's always good when the tools to create art get more accessable.
"More accessable" generally just meaning "cheaper", but the accessability is what matters.
Another way to make art "more accessable" is to literally make it less work to do.
Think the advancement of photography technology, from complex and skilled development in darkrooms on film, to not even needing to own a camera because
there's already one on the phone you already basically need to own for a myriad of
other reasons.

Currently, there's a debate centered on 'AI Art'.
Specifically, the kind of images made algorithmically through convolutional
neural networks (CNN) after they process what the experts call 'a metric fuckton' of input data.
The technology is really neat and the output is really impressive... so long as
you don't care too much if your art real has human emotions or half-decent hands.

According to the naysayers in the debate, the big problem with 'AI Art' is copyright.
See, in those huge sets of input data needed for a CNN to chew on to 'learn', every single image belongs to somebody in the eyes of the law.

A big thing to understand is that convolutional neural networks are no more
'intelligent' than any other algorithm.
There's not really any evidence we've come meaningfully closer to general
intelligence in the entire history of computing.









I would like to be for 'AI Art' because it does democratize the creative process
of creating images.
This means small creators who could use imagery but have no money and no connections and no resources and no visual art skills.
That's a "more accessable" way to make art for sure.

There are several processes of 'AI Art', but today the term almost exclusively used to refer
to a very specific kind of art made by convolutional neural networks after they
process what the experts call 'a metric fuckton' of input 'learning' data.
