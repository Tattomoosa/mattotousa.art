I recently got a camera to photograph paintings with so I can make prints.
I don't think I'll ever really consider myself a photographer,
but I have really enjoyed going out and doing photography.
It's interesting to me as a relative beginner to it thinking about some
of the ways it is and isn't like painting.

There is a bit of a sense that historically photographs *replaced*
paintings.
This is not really true, illustration was the actually primary way most families did portraits
or history was documented.
For much of its history, painters were the tools of the very rich.
But photography did have a huge impact on painting.
I think, among painters, there was a sense that photographs actually
set painting free.
Not right away, for a time the Impressionists were iconoclasts, rebels daring
to go against the great traditions of painting.

But I've noticed something really interesting when people
describe paintings that they don't ever seem to for photographs --
seeing a painting of the sea, they say may they can taste the salt,
or feel the wind.
These are sensations that neither a painting or a photograph can make real,
but for some reason people seem to *feel* paintings more.

So an aspect of the magic of painting is that painters can capture more than what is visual.
There's another kind of magic in painting too, though.
There is a connection, per brush stroke, since each one says something of both
the subject and the painter.
John Berger sums it up pretty well:

{{ quote(
  text="...the paint, in which one follows the traces of the painter's immediate
   gestures.  This has the effect of closing the distance in time between the
   painting of the picture and one's own act of looking at it.",
   author="John Berger",
   work="Ways of Seeing"
) }}

In contrast, the magic of photography, I think, is knowing that the moment you are seeing
is a real moment.
Experienced by you through the photographer.
That's pretty cool too.

Earlier in my life I admired effort, and painting seems like a lot more effort to
produce an image than a photograph.
But, besides being nonsense
(a photograph can take a lot of effort and a painting very little, after all),
that's a terrible criteria to try and judge by.
Some of my best paintings flowed out of me with very little effort at all,
and some I've worked and re-worked and I'm still not particularly happy with them.

There is no right way to make art,
and it doesn't matter how much effort it is,
or how many people like it,
or if they think it's deep or not.
It's just good to make it.
I feel like it makes life brighter.
