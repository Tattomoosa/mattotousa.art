I recently got a camera to photograph paintings with, so of course I've
also taken it out to shoot photos because why not.
I don't think I'll ever really consider myself a photographer,
but I have enjoyed going photographing more than I expected.
And now I can't help but think about the relationship between photographs
and paintings.

There is a bit of a sense that historically photographs *replaced*
paintings.
Among painters, there is more of a sense that photographs actually
set painting free.
No longer was it the best medium to express *reality as it is*.

But I've noticed something really interesting from people (especially non-artists)
describing paintings that they don't ever seem to do for photographs --
seeing a painting of the sea, they say may they can *taste* the salt, or 
feel the wind.
These are sensations that neither a painting or a photograph can make real,
but for some reason people seem to *feel* paintings more.

So an aspect of the magic of painting is that painters can capture more than what is visual.
The magic of photography, I think, is knowing that the moment you are seeing
is a real moment, in a way painting never is.
Very rare events caught in photography are *exhilerating*
