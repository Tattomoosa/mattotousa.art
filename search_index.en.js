magic of photography, I think, is knowing that the moment you\nare seeing is a real moment.\nExperienced by you through the photographer.\nThat's pretty cool too.\n\n\"Photorealistic\" art did not exist before photographs.\nPhotographs have in a very true sense defined what reality looks like to us now.\nOur eyes do not actually see the same as cameras do\n\nEarlier in my life I admired effort, and painting seems like a lot more effort to\nproduce an image than a photograph.\nBut, besides being nonsense\n(a photograph can take a lot of effort and a painting very little, I have learned this!),\nthat's a terrible criteria to try and judge anything by.\nSome of my best paintings flowed out of me with very little effort at all,\nand some I've worked and re-worked and I'm still not particularly happy with them.\nThere is no right way to make art,\nand it doesn't matter how much effort it is,\nor how many people like it,\nor if they think it's deep or not.\nIt's just good to make

already need to have for a thousand other reasons.\n'AI Art' has a lot of momentum right now.\nSpecifically, the kind of images made in convolutional\nneural networks after they process and 'learn' on
